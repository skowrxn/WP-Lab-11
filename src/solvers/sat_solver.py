    Usage
    -----
    Given a sudoku `grid: SudokuGrid` one should use static method `encode`
    to create a CNF representation:

        `sudoku_cnf = SudokuCNF.encode(grid)`

    To pass the representation into a SAT solver, one should use the `cnf` property:

        `with Solver(bootstrap_with=sudoku_cnf.cnf) as solver`

    Given a solution from a SAT solver (e.g. `solution = solver.get_model()`)
    one can translate it to a SudokuGrid via the `decode` method:

        `solution_grid =  sudoku_cnf.decode()`
